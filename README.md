<h3> Python Practice Project Temprature Forecast</h3>
<h4> Trained on real world data of Ahmedabad, Gujarat, India </h4>
<p>This Model is trained on Ahmedabad's Data from 1st January 2020 to 31st May 2022. Currently in development you can change the values in code to predict real time temprature and max temprature based on previous day's temprature & windspeed, previous day's temprature and previous day's max temprature respectively.</p>
<hr>
<p>This project first imports data, cleans it for analysis, new features are then engineered to make the prediction more accurate</p>
<small>The dataset is downloaded from : https://www.visualcrossing.com/weather-history/Ahmedabad,India/</small>
<hr>
<small>Genral requirements include pandas, matplotlib, scikit-learn and the given dataset or any other dataset with similar shape.</small>
